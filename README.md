- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning R and hope to learn more arcpy, or PyQGIS
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Critical GIS projects. 
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with implimenting R into a QIS environment. I know RShiny is going to be great, but I am not quite there yet. 
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about Lots of things, but primarily GIS, I will try to answer any question though as I enjoy learning about everything. 
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: Email Jesse.alexander.king@gmail.com

- âš¡ Fun fact: I used to compete in Cyclocross bicylce racing on my unicycle.  I would always get last because 1 wheel was way slower than 2.
